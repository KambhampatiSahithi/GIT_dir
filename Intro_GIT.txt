Git is a Version Control System (VCS), a tool which is an extremely smart choice to use even if it sounds too overwhelming. Simply put, a VCS is a group of files with monitored access. What does that mean? Let's consider a small example to help you understand.

If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout ( which you would most certainly want to), a VCS is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.
