There are four possible arguments when running
balancedsat. These are
numVars
The number of variables to be used. This should
be a multiple of the number of literals in each
clause (k).
numClauses The number of clauses to be used. If num-
Clauses is less than approximately 3.7*numVars
the generated benchmark is likely to be satisfi-
able and easy to solve. Above 3.7*numVars the
benchmark is likely be unsatisfiable.
